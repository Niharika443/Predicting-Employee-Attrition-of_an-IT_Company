# Predicting-Employee-Attrition-of_an-IT_Company
Business Objective: An IT company has a workforce of around 4,000 employees. Every year around 15% of the employees leave the company and need to be replaced with 
new hires. The leadership believes that 15% attrition is bad for the companyâ€™s revenue and future growth. So they need a model which guide the company to take timely 
action to retain as many employees as possible.


Understanding: Out of 4,000 employees in an IT company they show 15% attrition rate. We have to find the reasons behind the attrition and the solutions to make them 
sustain in the IT company through building a machine learning model. That predicts how likely it is for an employee to leave the company.


Approach: The first step involves the cleaning of the given data which includes identifying missing values , checking duplicate rows and dropping unnecessary columns. 
The next step is data preprocessing which involves exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. After collecting the data and analysing the patterns it exhibits, 
The predicted feature is of continous variable so a decision tree machine learning model has to be used to encounter this problem.
